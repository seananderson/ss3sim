#' Randomly generated standard-normal recruitment deviations
#'
#' These data are randomly generated recruitment deviations with mean
#' 0 and standard deviation 1. For legacy reasons (i.e. the matrix
#' size was enlarged in the middle of a study) they were generated
#' with the code listed in the example below.
#'
#' The columns are intended to be for iterations and the rows for
#' years. The matrix has intentionally constructed at a large size to
#' accommodate studies that work with simulations up to 125 years
#' long and with up to 500 iterations. If you want to work with more
#' iterations or longer time series then you'll need to specify your
#' own recdevs through the \code{user_recdevs} argument in
#' \code{\link{ss3sim_base}}. The function
#' \code{\link{change_rec_devs}} will throw out extra years of
#' recruitment deviations.
