\title{Extract SS3 simulation results for one scenario.}
\usage{
get_results_scenario(scenario, directory = getwd(), overwrite_files = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{scenario}{A single character giving the scenario from which to
extract results.}

\item{directory}{The directory which contains the scenario folder.}

\item{overwrite_files}{A boolean (default is FALSE) for whether to delete
any files previously created with this function. This is intended to be
used if replicates were added since the last time it was called, or any
changes were made to this function.}
}
\description{
Function that extracts results from all replicates inside a supplied
scenario folder. The function writes 3 .csv files to the scenario folder:
(1) scalar metrics with one value per replicate (e.g. $R_0$, $h$), (2) a
timeseries data ('ts') which contains multiple values per replicate (e.g.
$SSB_y$ for a range of years $y$), and (3) residuals on the log scale from
the surveys across all replicates (this feature is not fully tested!). The
function \code{get_results_all} loops through these .csv files and combines
them together into a single "final" dataframe.
